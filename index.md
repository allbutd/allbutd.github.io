### Why Are We Doing This
ABD is a space where graduate students affiliated with Canadian institutions of all types--professional, course, and research-based--can share their own unique voices and perspectives. The Canadian context presents its own distinct realities, and therefore we are prioritizing these perspectives. Academia often forces us to only bring a part of ourselves into our day-to-day, but this collective invites us to celebrate and bring every part of ourselves to the table. We want to meld the academic and non-academic aspects of our life, where we can critically talk about academia, share our art: be it from an R script gone wrong (or right!), your latest poem, short story, or painting, where you can share and identify areas for improvement with the pressures of academia, and where people can support each other. See our suggested topics or a non-exhaustive list of contribution topics! Don’t see something that interests you? Write anything else and go for it. 

Our social justice education is up to us, and we are not owed anything from the people structurally harmed by academia. We recognize that owning and shaping our own narratives and telling our own stories can be a powerful tool for survivors, and invite these discussions into this forum. The damage of academia, particularly towards marginalized communities through unethical research practices, parachute-research, and trauma voyeurism is a systemic problem, often enacted by graduate students. If you are not in academia, but you’ve experienced the harms of this or other types of academic activities, this is a collectively created supportive space for you to share your experience and perspective.

So there you have it. ABD is here for you. And not just your academic you. The full you.

### Who We Are
Both of us are geography students in what is now Canada. Aateka Shashank is a PhD candidate at Simon Fraser University, and Russell Copley is an MSc student at the University of Calgary. During the summer of 2020, we were walking around, catching up over bubble tea. One of the many things we were talking about was imagining a space where people could share their thoughts in as supportive a space as the one we had created for each other. We feel empowered around each other to share our thoughts, knowing that sometimes they’re not fully thought out, knowing that sometimes they run against the grain of what the old-guard academics would want. Knowing that many of our dreams would entail a fundamental restructuring--liberating--of academia, science, knowledge, and community. Ending the evening with kittens, we decided to build that space.

### Our Ethic
ABD is a decolonial, anti-racist, anti-classist, pro-2SLGBTQIA+, anti-ableist organization. We believe and support survivors of all kinds, both inside and outside the academy. We strive to create a space for people to bring their whole selves, without fear of needing to assimilate into institutionally approved “boxes”, and where their whole selves can be celebrated for the unique perspectives and expertise inherent by being, well, you. 

We seek no profit, no control, and no dictation of direction. The sole roles of Aateka Shashank and Russell Copley in the beginnings of this are to maintain the infrastructure and ensure submissions align with our stated ethics and commitments to inclusion. As the community builds, our commitment to a non-hierarchical and horizontal collective structure will only grow stronger as the diversity of people’s opinions becomes greater and greater. By attaching our names, we are not seeking to centre ourselves, but to provide a route for accountability, and a route for questions, comments, and concerns.

### Submissions and Submissions Policy
Our geographic restrictions are to promote deeper, more fleshed out reflections on Canadian institutions and the cultures they manifest. Anyone affiliated with a Canadian institution, or who has been impacted by the research or policies of Canadian institutions, regardless of where you’re from, are invited to participate. If you are part of academia, this is largely a venue for graduate students, but we invite undergraduates to participate as well. To keep this a space that’s comfortable for everyone, we will not be permitting faculty from any institution to write for this collective. While we appreciate and stand in solidarity with the precarious nature of so many early career academics, we are focusing on the experiences of those who have the fewest opportunities to speak up and out. 

Content which runs contrary to our ethics statement above will not be accepted. We celebrate freedom of expression, which requires defining the limits of acceptable discourse. In our case, we celebrate the freedom of expression of those most structurally silenced. 

In line with our ethics statement and commitment to accessibility, we ask that any audio content (such as podcasts or music) is submitted with a transcript, and that any non-text visual content is submitted alongside an ![image description](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images). ASCII art, which confuses text-to-speech tools, should only be included as an image with an associated image description. Image descriptions should be used on memes, art, ASCII art, charts/graphs/maps, and other non-text content. If a submission does not include this, we will ask that you add them before resubmitting.

Feel free to reach out to us if you would like to remain an anonymous contributor.

### Territory Acknowledgement and Solidarity
What is currently known as Canada has been, and is, under colonial occupation. Every inch of land from coast to coast across this continent is occupied, and as settlers, we have an obligation to work towards decolonization.

We have a short term goal and a long term goal for materially and consistently supporting Indigenous sovereignty movements. Our long term goal, if revenue streams become available, is to allocate the non website-maintenance required funds to grassroots Indigenous movements. 

We believe the lack of revenue streams should not be a barrier to commitment.  We support protest, direct action, or other civic acts which act in alignment with the stated goals of Indigenous Elders on the topic of decolonization. Look up supporters toolkits before getting involved in decolonial actions. We will aggregate and update ongoing movements across “Canada”. 

We also view this magazine as a platform and avenue for people to share their work, ideas, thoughts, of how to organize and undo the structures of harm in academia, a colonial institution on stolen land. We want to create a platform for these ideas, as a vocalization of the problems of our current setting is important to organizing across our disparate institutions.

### Join Our Collective! 
We would love to have you on our newsletter, where you'll be the first to get the monthly releases, and where we can better communicate goals, objectives, and decision making for the direction of the magazine.
